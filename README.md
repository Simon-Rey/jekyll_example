## 🧱 Project Structure

| Folder/File            | Purpose                                                                                                       |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `_layouts/`            | Defines the structure for different types of pages (e.g., `page`, `post`, `home`). Each page uses a layout defined in its YAML front matter (`layout: page`). |
| `*.md`                 | Markdown content pages. Pages are rendered using the assigned layout and can include [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templating. |
| `_data/`               | Stores reusable data in YAML/JSON/CSV files. You can reference this data in your pages or layouts using Liquid. |
| `assets/`              | Contains static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images. These are copied over during site build.              |
| `.github/workflows/`   | Contains GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment.                                                   |

## 📄 Example Features

- `team.md` shows how to render a page using external data from `_data/team_data.yml`.
- Layouts make it easy to maintain consistent page design.
- Easily extendable to support blogs, portfolios, documentation sites, and more.
- You can use includes to include pieces of code in several locations.

## 🚢 Deployment with GitHub Actions

This project is configured to deploy automatically using GitHub Actions.

- See the workflow in `.github/workflows/build_jekyll.yml`
- No manual setup is required — just **push your changes**, and the site is rebuilt automatically.
- Make sure GitHub Actions are enabled for your repository.

---

## 📌 Notes

- Layouts are defined in the `_layouts` folder.
- Pages declare their layout in the YAML front matter: `layout: page`, `layout: default`, etc.
- Data used across pages (like team members or product info) lives in the `_data` folder.
- Static files like images, CSS, and JavaScript go in the `assets` folder.
